# OIBSIP-PROJECT-4-PROPOSAL-LEVEL-2

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the Google Play Store dataset to uncover insights and trends in the Android app market. The dataset contains information about various apps, including their categories, ratings, price, and more. Through this analysis, we aim to understand the distribution of apps across categories, pricing trends, app ratings, and user sentiments from reviews.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of two CSV files:
1. **App Data** - Information about apps on the Google Play Store, including app name, category, rating, size, installs, type, and more.
2. **Reviews Data** - Reviews of apps, including translated reviews, sentiment analysis results, and review-related data.

### Dataset Source:
- [Google Play Store Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utshabkumarghosh/android-app-market-on-google-play)

## Key Insights and Analysis
- **Category Exploration**: Analyze the distribution of apps across different categories (e.g., Games, Education, Health & Fitness).
- **Price Analysis**: Investigate pricing trends and app price distributions.
- **Ratings & Popularity**: Explore the app ratings, their correlation with installs, and how apps rank based on popularity.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assess user sentiments in app reviews and categorize them into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.

## Key Concepts
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, incorrect data types, and format inconsistencies.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize app data and generate insights through different charts (e.g., bar charts, histograms, box plots).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Use NLP techniques to analyze the sentiments of app reviews and categorize them into positive, neutral, or negative.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- TextBlob: Sentiment analysis

## Steps Followed
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and format data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution and relationships of app attributes.
